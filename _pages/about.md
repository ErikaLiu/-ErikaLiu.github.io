This is Dr. Zheng Liu (刘铮), a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at ByteDance Inc. 

Our team mainly works on [Marscode](https://www.marscode.com/), a cloud IDE platform with built-in AI programming assistant with capabilities like code completion, explanation, and debugging for faster development. My duty is to analyze multiple programming languages, including Go, Java, and C++, and adopt various Large Language Models to achieve this goal.


I received my PhD from the University of Illinois at Chicago, where I was supervised by [Prof. Philip Yu](https://cs.uic.edu/profiles/philip-yu/). My PhD research focused on addressing the trustworthiness and versatility issues in machine learning/deep learning applications, such as Recommender Systems and Electronic Health Records analysis.

I received my bachelor's degree from Beihang University in 2016.
